React is a flexible and lightweight library that improves the performance of an app. React can be installed without the user's configuration. The package manager can either be **NPM** or **yarn**, and the tool or package is **create-react-app**. We will install via npm instead.

> **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)** will be used instead. To use the **NPM** package to create a React app, [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

Follow the steps below to install React:

1.) Open VS Code in any terminal (root directory).

```bash
code .
```
2.) Open VS Code terminal, `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `'`

3.) Navigate to the Desktop directory.

```bash
cd Desktop
```
4.) Create a React app (my-app). For Windows.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app 
```
5.) Create a React app (my-app). For Mac and Linux.

```bash
sudo npx create-react-app my-app
```
6.) Change directory to project folder, my-app.

```bash
cd my-app
```
7.) Start a development server.

```bash
npm start
```

> The development server runs the app at port 3000 on your local machine by default, http://localhost:3000/. If the port is different, it means another server is already running at port 3000.

If interested to install React online follow the steps below:

- Click the *Shell* navigation tab.
- Follow steps 4 - 7.

The installation process is documented on the [Facebook Github repository](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md)

After installation of React, the most relevant folders in the my-app project are structured as shown below:

```bash
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
    └── setupTests.js
```

**Happy Coding!!!**
